# Lab-10---SVM
Lab_10 Data Mining
After messing around with different C and gamma values. I found the following:
C=1000.0, gamma=1e-06, accuracy=0.9000
C=1000.0, gamma=1e-07, accuracy=0.9000
C=10000.0, gamma=1e-07, accuracy=0.9000
C=100000.0, gamma=1e-06, accuracy=0.9000
C=100000.0, gamma=1e-07, accuracy=0.9000
All of these had an accuracy of 90% where the other tests I did only came out to 80%. So, 
I can conclude that this is the most accurate I was able to find. I was confused on the second part of this lab but I gave it my best attempt.
